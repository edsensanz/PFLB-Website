# PFLB-Website
A basic website using many things such as flask and django. Database used in areas such as user login and user data.

This website has used a lot of python packages that will be required to run it. I cannot exactly remember all of them but it is pretty self explantatory.
To run the website open up your terminal or windows command prompt (depending or your OS) and run the command 
-> python .../PFLB-Redo/main.py
where the ... is replaced with the directory of the PFLB-Redo file.
This will start a server running on the ip 127.0.0.1:5000 where if you type that into your browser while it is running the website will show.
I have been using the anaconda interface in order to edit and delete any information stored inside the database, however, any other interface program would work.


If you encounter any problems running or accessing the code let me know.

Additionally any feedback of anything I could add to the functionality right now would be great.


A clear instruction README.  Very encouraging to see the use of markdown.
